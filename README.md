# gRPC-Hello-Server

This Go-based gRPC server provides two endpoints: SayHello, returning a simple greeting, and WhoAmI, which mimics Traefikâ€™s /whoami by echoing the caller's IP address, user-agent, and hostname. The server is compiled into a statically linked binary and runs from a minimal scratch Docker image with no extra dependencies, making it ideal for secure and lightweight deployments in containerized environments like Kubernetes.
